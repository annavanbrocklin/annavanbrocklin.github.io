    "section": "",
    "text": "Last year the NCAA DI Men’s Cross Country Championship took place in Charlottesville, Virginia. The meet was hosted by the University of Virginia and Director, Carter Olander. The men’s race was 10,000 kilometers. With over 250 runners, times at the meet ranged from times of 28:37 to 34:16.\nWhen taking a brief look at the data, there seems to be a great number of underclassmen within the top finishers of the race.\nThis leads to wondering how big of an impact experience has in college cross country.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nxc_log &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/annav/OneDrive/Desktop/SPMC PROJECT/data/xc_log.csv\")\n\n\nxc_log &lt;- xc_log %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n  \n    TIME = str_replace_all(TIME, \"[^0-9:.]\", \"\"),\n\n    \n    time_sec = ifelse(\n      str_detect(TIME, \":\"),\n      as.numeric(str_extract(TIME, \"^\\\\d+\")) * 60 + as.numeric(str_extract(TIME, \"(?&lt;=:)\\\\d+\")),\n      as.numeric(TIME)\n    ),\n\n   \n    finish_status = ifelse(is.na(time_sec), \"DNF\", \"Finished\"),\n\n    class = case_when(\n      str_detect(YEAR, \"FR\") ~ \"Freshman\",\n      str_detect(YEAR, \"SO\") ~ \"Sophomore\",\n      str_detect(YEAR, \"JR\") ~ \"Junior\",\n      str_detect(YEAR, \"SR\") ~ \"Senior\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(data = xc_log, aes(x = PL, y = class, color = class)) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(color = class), size = 3, alpha = 0.7, height = 0.25, width = 0.2, shape = 16) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Place\",\n    y = NULL,  \n    title = \"Does More Experience Matter?\",\n    subtitle = \"Individual Runner Performances Appear to Vary Randomly Regardless of Year.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Track & Field Results Reporting System | Analysis by Anna Van Brocklin\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(\n    limits = c(\"Freshman\", \"Sophomore\", \"Junior\", \"Senior\")  \n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Freshman\" = \"#8B0000\", \"Sophomore\" = \"#00003f\",\n              \"Junior\" = \"#033504\", \"Senior\" = \"#e6c200\",\n              \"DNF\" = \"black\"),\n    breaks = c(\"Freshman\", \"Sophomore\", \"Junior\", \"Senior\", \"DNF\")\n  ) +\n  guides(shape = \"none\") +  \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nThe findings from our data show a decently even spread between runners of each year. There are noticeable patterns within the data, but this plot alone isn’t enough to prove one way or another in terms of whether experience has a significant impact on a runner’s performance in cross country.\nWhile we can see the groupings of runners that finished in the middle of the pack within the juniors and seniors, we can also see that freshman and sophomores tend to have a more even spread with runners evenly spaced throughout the race\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = xc_log, aes(x = YEAR, y = TIME, fill = YEAR)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"summary\", fun = \"mean\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"FR-1\" = \"#8B0000\",  # Dark Red\n      \"SO-2\" = \"#00003f\",  # Dark Blue\n      \"JR-3\" = \"#033504\",  # Dark Green\n      \"SR-4\" = \"#e6c200\"   # Gold\n    ),\n    labels = c(\n      \"FR-1\" = \"Freshman\",\n      \"SO-2\" = \"Sophomore\",\n      \"JR-3\" = \"Junior\",\n      \"SR-4\" = \"Senior\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\n    labels = c(\n      \"FR-1\" = \"Freshman\",\n      \"SO-2\" = \"Sophomore\",\n      \"JR-3\" = \"Junior\",\n      \"SR-4\" = \"Senior\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Average Race Time (Minutes)\", \n    title = \"Underclassmen Take the Lead.\", \n    subtitle = \"Comparing the Average Race Times for Each Class.\", \n    caption = \"Source: Track & Field Results Reporting System | Analysis by Anna Van Brocklin\"\n  ) +\n\ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom our data it is clear when looking at the averages between seniors, juniors, sophomores and freshmen that underclassmen take the lead, at least when their times are averaged together.\nHowever, it’s important to know, there 157 upperclassmen runners in this specific race, with only 79 underclassmen runners which could have a major impact on the average race times overall. While this works both ways, there are less underclassmen to impact the class average.\nIt’s also worth noting that despite the data showing juniors in last according to the average, out of all four years, juniors individually made up 50% of the top 10 runners. This is why it is important to look at our data in different ways, as one visual can tell one side of a story and another can tell a different perspective.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nxc_log_clean &lt;- xc_log %&gt;%\n  filter(!TIME %in% c(\"DNF\", \"DNS\")) %&gt;%  # Remove rows with DNF or DNS\n  mutate(\n    FinishingTime = as.numeric(str_extract(TIME, \"^\\\\d+\")) * 60 +  # Extract minutes and convert to seconds\n                    as.numeric(str_extract(TIME, \"\\\\d+$\")),\n    Class = case_when(\n      grepl(\"^FR|^SO\", YEAR) ~ \"Underclassmen\",  # Freshman or Sophomore\n      grepl(\"^JR|^SR\", YEAR) ~ \"Upperclassmen\",   # Junior or Senior\n      TRUE ~ \"Other\"                           # Handle other cases as \"Other\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\nggplot(xc_log_clean, aes(x = FinishingTime / 60, fill = Class)) +  \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7, fill = \"grey\") +  \n  facet_wrap(~ Class, nrow = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Is Beginner's Luck the Key to Success?\",\n    subtitle = \"Underclassmen Runners Show Promising Talent, but is that Enough to Beat Experienced Runners?\n\",\n    x = \"Finishing Time (Minutes)\",\n    y = \"Number of Runners\",\n    caption = \"Source: Track & Field Results Reporting System | By Anna Van Brocklin\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.margin = margin(15, 15, 15, 15)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile both underclassmen and upperclassmen appear to be more skewed to the left, faster times, underclassmen have a slight edge compared to the older runners. This suggests that newer runners are not only keeping pace with their more experienced counterparts but are also pushing the boundaries of performance.\nThat being said, upperclassmen have more runners finishing in the midst of the race, with times closer to the overall average. It can also be said that upperclassmen seem to have less runners towards the right of the race, which shows they tend to be a bit more consistent overall.\nThe data from the NCAA DI Men’s Cross Country Championship reveals interesting patterns in performance across different class levels. While seniors emerge as the top performers on average, the consistency of underclassmen, particularly among the top finishers, is notable. Although juniors lag behind a group, they tend to perform well individually, in terms of placing runners.\nWhile visually the two groups look different in terms of their data, as a whole, one group of runners doesn’t seem to have a strong advantage over the others, at least in this particular race. To get a better idea of the data and consistencies, we’d most likely need to look at more races and make comparisons to prior year’s races.\nWe do see clear differences in the data between the different years of runners, however, there are a few factors that could lead to this such as coaching, training, injury history and of course individual talent. Additionally, there 157 upperclassmen runners in this specific race, with only 79 underclassmen runners which could have a major impact on the average race times overall.\nInterestingly, while underclassmen display a wider range of finishing times, capturing both some of the fastest and slowest, upperclassmen often cluster around middle performance ranges. This distribution ultimately balances out, with both groups achieving comparable average times. These findings suggest that while underclassmen are slightly favored in this race, there isn’t a clear winner being newer and experienced runners, emphasizing a fairly level playing field for the 2023 DI Cross Country Championship."

    "section": "",
    "text": "With outstanding achievements and recognition from her university and the nation, Alexis Markowski has become a significant player in women’s college basketball.\nThe Nebraska native has begun her fourth year playing for the Nebraska Huskers.\nTo fully assess Alexis Markowski’s performance evolution, we’ll examine several statistics across her prior seasons. By analyzing trends in points scored, minutes played, and other statistics like rebounds, steals, blocks, and assists, we can gain a valuable look into her development as a player.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmarkowski_id &lt;- 4899057  \n\nget_markowski_stats &lt;- function(year, season_type) {\n  espn_wbb_player_stats(athlete_id = markowski_id, year = year, season_type = season_type, total = TRUE)\n}\n\nmarkowski_stats_2022 &lt;- get_markowski_stats(2022, \"regular\")\nmarkowski_stats_2023 &lt;- get_markowski_stats(2023, \"regular\")\nmarkowski_stats_2024 &lt;- get_markowski_stats(2024, \"regular\")\n\nmarkowski_all_stats &lt;- rbind(markowski_stats_2022, markowski_stats_2023, markowski_stats_2024)\n\nmarkowski_all_stats$year &lt;- c(rep(2022, nrow(markowski_stats_2022)),\n                              rep(2023, nrow(markowski_stats_2023)),\n                              rep(2024, nrow(markowski_stats_2024)))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(markowski_all_stats, aes(x = year, y = general_minutes)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(size=2, color=\"#B56003\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Total Minutes Played\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Slow and Steady Wins the Game.\",\n    subtitle = \"Markowski's Consistent Rise in Playing Time.\",\n    caption = \"By: Anna Van Brocklin | Source: Wehoop: The SportsDataverse\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\n\nTo best understand Markowski’s performance record, we need to first break down how she became the player she is today. By simply looking at Markowski’s minutes played, we can see a steady increase in playing time throughout her college career. While it is natural for a player’s minutes on the court to rise with experience, the increase we see hints that Markowski is heading in the right direction.\nThis rise in playing time suggests the key player Markowski has become for the Huskers and that she is trusted to perform well consistently. We can additionally conclude that the team’s success has a significant reliance on Markowski’s contributions throughout each game.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(markowski_all_stats, aes(x = year, y = offensive_points)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(size=2, color=\"#B56003\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Total Points Scored\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A Scoring Surge.\",\n    subtitle = \"Markowski's Total Points Each Year.\",\n    caption = \"By: Anna Van Brocklin | Source: Wehoop: The SportsDataverse\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next finding from the data is similar to our previous plot as it shows the progression of points scored over Markowski’s past three seasons.\nThis graph reveals a significant upward trend in Markowski’s scoring ability. Her increase in total points scored from 2022 to 2024 indicates a progressive improvement in her offensive skills. Markowski’s increase in points could be attributed to factors such as increased playing time. However, we also can determine that some of the points came from Markowski’s enhanced shooting accuracy and improved decision-making on the court.\nWhile she suffered a lack of points in her second year compared to her first, Markowski scored an impressive 549 points in her third season with the Huskers, which ultimately led to breaking over 1,000 points in 2023. This drive speaks to Markowski’s effort and hard work during the preseason and her improved ability to score.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(markowski_all_stats, aes(x = general_minutes, y = offensive_points)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color=\"#B56003\") +  \n  facet_wrap(~year) +\n  labs(x = \"Total Minutes Played\", y = \"Total Points Scored\") + \n    labs(\n    title = \"An Impressive Comeback.\",\n    subtitle = \"A Comparison of Playing Time to Points Scored.\",\n    caption = \"By: Anna Van Brocklin | Source: Wehoop: The SportsDataverse\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can next take the knowledge we have to consider the relationship between Markowski’s minutes played and points scored. This graph forms a clearer picture of the difference in each season while collecting each element into one graphic.\nLooking at Markowski’s first season, we can see that this season provided the least amount of playing time for her. In her second year, we see the playing time increase significantly, but a slight drop in overall points. Lastly, in her third season, we see an increase in playing time and vast jump points.\nThis graph supports the correlation between points scored and minutes played across the three seasons, in addition to the improvements and skills that Markowski has demonstrated in her time with the Huskers. As Markowski’s playing time increases, so does her scoring output. This suggests that she is efficient in converting her playing time into points.\n\n\nCode\nmarkowski_long &lt;- markowski_all_stats %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(offensive_avg_points, offensive_avg_assists, defensive_avg_steals, defensive_avg_blocks, defensive_avg_defensive_rebounds),\n               names_to = \"category\",\n               values_to = \"value\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(markowski_long, aes(x = year, y = value, fill = category)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"offensive_avg_points\" = \"#B56003\",\n                              \"offensive_avg_assists\" = \"#264356\",\n                              \"defensive_avg_steals\" = \"#566750\",\n                              \"defensive_avg_blocks\" = \"#CBDFBD\",\n                              \"defensive_avg_defensive_rebounds\" = \"#F7A129\"),\n                    labels = c(\"Blocks\", \"Defensive Rebounds\", \"Steals\", \"Assists\", \"Points\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Number\", fill = \"Key\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"An Upward Trend for Markowski.\",\n    subtitle = \"A Year-by-Year Breakdown of Markowski's Average Statistics.\",\n    caption = \"By: Anna Van Brocklin | Source: Wehoop: The SportsDataverse\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Totals\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, to further understand Markowski’s progression in her performance, we’ll take a look at multiple of her average stats per game. We of course find points at the top of Markowski’s stats, with the same pattern we looked at before. At her peak performance in 2023, Markowski was scoring an average of just over 15 points per game, leading to wonder if this trend will continue in the current season. Up next is Markowski’s defensive rebound, with a nice upward trend. We see the same for her average assists, however, Markowski’s steals have remained decently consistent and her number of blocks has slightly decreased.\nFrom this detailed breakdown, we have a better idea of Markowski’s various statistics indicating that Markowski has become a well-rounded player and contributes to the team both defensively and offensively.\nMarkowski’s performance over the last three seasons shows that she is trending upward. Her increased scoring ability, in addition to her role in the team, and improved efficiency in converting minutes into points on the court is noteworthy.\nWith the direction she is heading at the start of a new season, Markowski has the potential to further grow and not only make significant contributions to the Huskers’ success but prove to be one of the most valuable college players in the nation."
