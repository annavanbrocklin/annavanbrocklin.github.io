    "text": "Last year the NCAA DI Men’s Cross Country Championship took place in Charlottesville, Virginia. The meet was hosted by the University of Virginia and Director, Carter Olander. The men’s race was 10,000 kilometers. With over 250 runners, times at the meet ranged from 29:11 to 34:16.\nWhen taking a brief look at the data, there seems to be a great number of underclassmen within the top finishers of the race.\nThis leads to wondering how big of an impact experience has in college cross country.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyverse' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\n#| label: load-data\nlibrary(readr)\nxc_log &lt;- read_csv(\"C:/Users/annav/OneDrive/Desktop/SPMC PROJECT/data/xc_log.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 255 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (4): NAME, YEAR, TEAM, TIME\ndbl  (2): PL, SCORE\ntime (1): Avg.

However when we take a deeper look, we can see that while underclassmen have more runners finishing with the fastest and slowest times, more upperclassmen runners are finishing within the middle of these times.\nComparing the two, the underclassmen variety of finishing times averages out to be similar to the upperclassmen’s times, making them a pretty even mix.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\nxc_log_filtered &lt;- xc_log %&gt;%\n  filter(!TIME %in% c(\"DNS\", \"DNF\"))\n\n\nxc_log_filtered$TIME &lt;- ms(xc_log_filtered$TIME)\n\n\nWarning in .parse_hms(..., order = \"MS\", quiet = quiet): Some strings failed to\nparse\n\n\nCode\navg_times &lt;- xc_log_filtered %&gt;%\n  group_by(YEAR) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_time = mean(TIME))\n\n\nggplot(avg_times, aes(x = avg_time, y = YEAR, fill = YEAR)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_y_discrete(limits = c(\"FR-1\", \"SO-2\", \"JR-3\", \"SR-4\"),\n                   labels = c(\"Freshman\", \"Sophomore\", \"Junior\", \"Senior\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#8B0000\", \"#033504\", \"#00003f\", \"#e6c200\"),\n                   labels = c(\"Freshman\", \"Sophomore\", \"Junior\", \"Senior\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 35), breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35)) + \n  labs(x = \"Average Race Time (Minutes)\", \n       y = \"Year\", \n       title = \"New Runners are Challenging Upperclassmen\",\n       subtitle = \"Experienced Runners Lead the Pack, but Underclassmen aren't Far Behind\",\n       caption = \"Source: Track & Field Results Reporting System | By Anna Van Brocklin\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 8))\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at average times between classes, seniors have a strong lead. However at the same time, third year runners come in last. The underclassmen aren’t quite on the same level in comparison to the seniors, however, both freshman and sophomores are consistent and fall right in between the juniors and seniors.\nWhile this doesn’t prove either group to be overwhelmingly faster than another, we can see that seniors are the top performers on average while underclassmen show more consistency in terms of top performers.\nThe data from the NCAA DI Men’s Cross Country Championship reveals interesting patterns in performance across different class levels. While seniors emerge as the top performers on average, the consistency of underclassmen, particularly among the top finishers, is notable. Although juniors lag behind, freshmen and sophomores hold their own, bridging the gap between the less experienced and the experienced runners.\nInterestingly, while underclassmen display a wider range of finishing times, capturing both some of the fastest and slowest, upperclassmen often cluster around middle performance ranges. This distribution ultimately balances out, with both groups achieving comparable average times. These findings suggest that while experience may play a role, it doesn’t overwhelmingly favor one class level over another, emphasizing a fairly level playing field in college cross country."
